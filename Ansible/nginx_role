2. Write a role that will install nginx and will configure default website provided by www server.
 
     2.1 Common role ( will be run as a dependency of nginx role) that will create devops group and admin user (with ssh key generation - 2048) 
     2.2 Install a web server. In this case, we will use 'Nginx' as it is a lightweight web server
     2.3 Manage configuration for the Nginx web server
     2.4 Start the web server after installing it (in OS)
     2.5 Copy default.conf and index.html files to remote-host, they will be served as a www server home page 
     2.6 Restart nginx service using handler after default.conf or index.html file change
